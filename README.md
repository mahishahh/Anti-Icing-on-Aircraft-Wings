# Anti-Icing System Modeling for Aircraft Wings

Ice formation on aircraft wings can significantly compromise flight safety by increasing drag and reducing lift. This project focuses on modeling the **heat transfer, mass transfer**, and **momentum interactions** involved in ice formation and removal. The goal is to analyze and optimize the performance of anti-icing systems, ensuring enhanced safety, improved fuel efficiency, and reduced maintenance costs.
